                <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m a Computer Science student currently studying at Queen’s University Belfast, but my learning
                    does not stop there. I am constantly learning new technologies, systems, techniques, and concepts to
                    further my knowledge. I have a great interest in the subject, and I make a hobby out of coding and
                    computers. I have multiple projects and skills I am developing at any given time.

                    Beyond coding, being one of my main hobbies, I have been going to the gym on a consistent schedule
                    for nearly 4 years, demonstrating self-motivation, discipline, and the ability to follow through on
                    both short- and long-term goals. Additionally, I am a proficient cook, showcasing my time management
                    skills, ability to juggle multiple time-sensitive tasks, and creativity in following precise
                    instructions while experimenting with new ideas. I can also cook a fantastic steak.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I am a good fit for almost any computer-related job due to my passion for the subject,
                    valuable knowledge, and constant thirst to expand my understanding and fill knowledge gaps.
